FOCUS OF STUDY/PROJECT

The project started by providing a technology tool that proffers a lasting solution to the real estate industry from the ground up. The technology solution addresses the issue of land title registration at state's or federal land registries all over the country.

FEASIBILITY STUDY

Real estate is a unique asset class. It is tangible and is one of the most stable asset classes from time immemorial. Although, real estate is dealt with physically, the transaction ecosystem foro real estate is virtually in the dark.

COMPETITION
The technology solution does not have any competition in terms of geography. Virtually all blockchain innovation in this area of ownership and governance deals focuses on fractional ownership of land. Meanwhile, the main focus of our project is to provide a solution to the land registries of the states in the countries of our case study and provide an efficient transfer of land in the real estate ecosystem.

SMART CONTRACTS
