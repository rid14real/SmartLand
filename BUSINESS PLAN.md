SMARTLAND WHITEPAPER

OVERVIEW OF SMARTLAND

This team which is part of the Binance Masterclass Project is focused on re-imagining the real estate industry taking specific African countries as case study.This will render the industry to be more open, transparent, and stress-free.
The instant project concentrates on property right ecosystems which is not limited to registries, land titling, and helping various real estate stakeholders to understand the great impact of blockchain on the ancient and promising industry. Moreover, real estate is all over and around us.Speak of your home, retail shops down the street and large corporations.
There are three major stakeholders in the real estate industry. They include property seekers, service providers, and institutional owners.

FOCUS OF STUDY/PROJECT

The project started by providing a technology tool that proffers a lasting solution to the real estate industry from the ground up. The technology solution addresses the issue of land title registration at state's or federal land registries all over the country.

MARKET STRUCTURE

Real estate is the largest asset class in the world, roughly $27,200...


FEASIBILITY STUDY

Real estate is a unique asset class. It is tangible and is one of the most stable asset classes from time immemorial. Although, real estate is dealt with physically, the transaction ecosystem foro real estate is virtually in the dark.

COMPETITION

The technology solution does not have any competition in terms of geography. Virtually all blockchain innovation in this area of ownership and governance deals focuses on fractional ownership of land. Meanwhile, the main focus of our project is to provide a solution to the land registries of the states in the countries of our case study and provide an efficient transfer of land in the real estate ecosystem.

SMART CONTRACTS

The token standard that was used in this project is the ERC721 tokens. It is the perfect token because it is indivisible and not interchangeable, hence its uniqueness. They can only be traded in whole unit

Web3.js

Web3 Provider: The SmartLand dApp uses Metamask as its web3 provider. This is to enable users to be able to interact with the dApp, hence it is Metamask-compatible. As popularly used, the Metamask web3 provider will also be used by the users to sign transactions with their private key. This is another advantage the blockchain provides, it prevents another person from forging a users transaction.
A boilerplate code is provided in the front-end code to require users to install Metamask if they don't have it installed already.
Talking to the smart contracts: Web3.js needs the contract address and ABI to be able to talk to the contract. After deploying the smart contract on Ethereum or BSC SmartChain, the contract gets a fixed address on the blockchain (Ethereum or SmartChain) where it will be hosted forever. On the other hand, the Application Binary Interface (ABI) is the representation of the contract's methods in JSON format that instructs Web.js how to format function calls in a way the contract will understand. The compiler provides the ABI when the contract is compiled. This and the address mentioned above would be copied and saved. The ABI can be accessed on a JavaScript file later in the project. After the above steps, the contract address and ABI is instantiated on web3.js.
